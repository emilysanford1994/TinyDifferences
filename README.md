Code:<br>
"Models.rmd" contains the code used to fit each of our models to discrimination task data.<br>
All packages required to run the code are noted in the first chunk of the R Markdown file.


Data:<br>
"Full Dataset.csv" contains all trials from the 412 subjects who completed the experiment.<br>
"sample_data.csv" contains the trimmed dataset over which statistical analyses were run (of 412 subjects, 2 were excluded due to low accuracy).


Stimuli:<br>
"Sample Stimuli" contains stimuli from 20 of the test trials in the experiment, from the sequential condition.<br>
The naming convention is "pair_img_n1_n2.png"<br>
pair = pair number (indicates which images were paired together for a given trial)<br>
img = whether that particular image is the first (1) or second (2) image displayed on that trial<br>
n1 = number of dots in the first image<br>
n2 = number of dots in the second image<br>
