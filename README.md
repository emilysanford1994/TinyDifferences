The R Markdown file contains the code used to fit each of our models to discrimination task data.
All packages required to run the code are noted in the first chunk of the R Markdown file.


The csv file contains a sample of real data from our experiment.
You should be able to run the models over this sample data.



The folder "Sample Stimuli" contains stimuli from 20 of the test trials in the experiment, from the sequential condition.
The naming convention is "pair_img_n1_n2.png"
pair = pair number (indicates which images were paired together for a given trial)
img = whether that particular image is the first (1) or second (2) image displayed on that trial
n1 = number of dots in the first image
n2 = number of dots in the second image
